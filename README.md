* [CNVkit](https://github.com/etal/cnvkit)
* [Canvas](https://github.com/Illumina/canvas)
* [VarScan 2](https://github.com/dkoboldt/varscan)

2. Nanostring's CNV panel is analyzed according to their recommended protocol.

3. Illumina's CytoSNP 850k array data is analyzed according to the segmentation procedure [here](http://varscan.sourceforge.net/copy-number-calling.html#copy-number-methods).
